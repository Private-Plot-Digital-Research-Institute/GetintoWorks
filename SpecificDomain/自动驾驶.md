### 计算机视觉
1. Explain your lane detection algorithm.
   Solution: A common lane detection algorithm is based on the Hough Transform, which detects lines in an image. The process usually involves converting the image to grayscale, applying Gaussian blur, using the Canny edge detection algorithm, and finally applying the Hough Transform to detect lines. Improvements can be made by incorporating machine learning techniques or using more advanced algorithms like advanced lane finding, which takes into account curves and hills[1].

2. What are the advantages and disadvantages of cameras, lidar, and radar for autonomous vehicles?
   Solution: Cameras provide high-resolution images and can recognize colors, but they are sensitive to lighting conditions and have limited range. Lidar provides accurate distance measurements and can create detailed 3D maps, but it is expensive and can be affected by weather conditions. Radar is less affected by weather conditions and can measure velocity, but it has lower resolution and can struggle with object recognition[1].

3. How do you handle sensor fusion in self-driving cars?
   Solution: Sensor fusion involves combining data from multiple sensors (e.g., cameras, lidar, radar, GPS, and IMU) to create a more accurate and robust understanding of the environment. This can be achieved using techniques like Kalman filters or particle filters, which combine and weigh the data from different sensors to estimate the vehicle's state and the state of surrounding objects.

4. What is the role of machine learning in autonomous vehicles?
   Solution: Machine learning plays a crucial role in various aspects of autonomous vehicles, such as perception (object detection, classification, and tracking), prediction (predicting the future behavior of other road users), and decision-making (planning and control). Deep learning techniques like convolutional neural networks (CNNs) and recurrent neural networks (RNNs) are commonly used for these tasks.

5. How do you ensure the safety of an autonomous vehicle's decision-making process?
   Solution: Ensuring safety in decision-making can be achieved through various methods, such as incorporating safety constraints in the optimization problem, using formal methods to verify the correctness of the algorithms, and employing redundancy in the system (e.g., multiple sensors and algorithms). Additionally, extensive testing and validation, both in simulation and real-world scenarios, are crucial to ensure the safety of the autonomous vehicle.

6. What is the role of localization and mapping in self-driving cars?
   Solution: Localization is the process of determining the vehicle's position and orientation within a known map, while mapping involves creating a representation of the environment. Both are essential for autonomous vehicles to navigate safely and accurately. Techniques like simultaneous localization and mapping (SLAM) can be used to perform both tasks concurrently, using sensor data to update the vehicle's position and the map simultaneously.

7. How do you handle occlusions and dynamic objects in the environment?
   Solution: Handling occlusions and dynamic objects can be achieved by incorporating probabilistic models in the perception and prediction algorithms. For example, using Bayesian filters like Kalman filters or particle filters can help estimate the state of occluded or partially visible objects. Additionally, incorporating motion models and predicting the future behavior of dynamic objects can help the autonomous vehicle make safer and more informed decisions.

8. What are some challenges in the development and deployment of self-driving cars?
   Solution: Some challenges include:
   - Ensuring safety and reliability in various driving conditions
   - Handling complex and unpredictable traffic scenarios
   - Developing accurate and efficient perception, prediction, and decision-making algorithms
   - Addressing legal, ethical, and regulatory issues
   - Gaining public trust and acceptance
   - Reducing the cost of sensors and computing hardware
